This is a small project inspired by a Facebook ad for a literary clock (that tells time by displaying quotes from book that contain the current time), and repository of jpwhally, literaryclock (https://github.com/jpwhalley/literaryclock). I didn't do the hard work of finding 1440 quotes for each minute of the day. For that, I am indebted to the 'literaryclock' repository (used here under an MIT license. See LICENSE.)
